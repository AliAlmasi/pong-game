# Simple pong game with JS

This is a basic implementation of the Atari Pong game

## To-do list

- Score:
  - The other player should score a point when a ball goes past a paddle. Points should be shown in-game.
- Ball trajectory:
  - The ball should change trajectory based on where it hit the paddle. For example, if it hit the topmost part of the paddle it should have a sharp angle upward, whereas if it hit the direct middle of the paddle it should move completely flat towards the other payer.
