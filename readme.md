# Basic Pong HTML and JavaScript Game

This is a basic implementation of the Atari Pong game

## To do list

- Score:
  - When a ball goes past a paddle, the other player should score a point. Points should be shown in game.
- Ball trajectory:
  - The ball should change trajectory based on where it hit the paddle. For example, if it hit the topmost part of the paddle it should have a sharp angle upward, whereas if it hit the direct middle of the paddle it should move completely flat towards the other payer.
